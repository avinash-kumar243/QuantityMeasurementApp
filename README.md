### 🎯 Objective
- Add Temperature measurement category  
- Support Celsius & Fahrenheit  
- Restrict invalid arithmetic operations

- Created `TemperatureUnit` enum  
- Implemented formula-based conversion logic  
- Allowed equality comparison  
- Restricted unsupported arithmetic (e.g., adding two temperatures directly)  
- Applied measurable abstraction refactoring  

### 🧠 Architectural Enhancement
- Introduced selective arithmetic capability  
- Improved domain modeling  
- Applied behavior-driven restrictions
