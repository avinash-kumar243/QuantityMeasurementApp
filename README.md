### 🔹 UC12 – Subtraction & Division Operations  
**Branch:**  `feature/UC12-SubtractionAndDivision`

### 🎯 Objective
- Extend arithmetic support  
- Enable subtraction between quantities  
- Support division operations  

### ✅ Implementation
- Added `subtract()` method  
- Added `divide()` method  
- Ensured same-category enforcement  
- Maintained base unit conversion logic  
- Precision-safe arithmetic  

### ⚙ Design Principle
All arithmetic operations follow:
1. Convert to base unit  
2. Perform operation  
3. Convert to target unit
