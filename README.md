## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Quantity Measurement Application** is designed to validate equality, conversion, and arithmetic operations between different measurement units such as Feet, Inches, Yards, etc.

This project was implemented incrementally using:

- ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- ✅ Feature Branch Workflow
- ✅ Clean Code Practices
- ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle
- ✅ Proper Unit Conversion Strategy
